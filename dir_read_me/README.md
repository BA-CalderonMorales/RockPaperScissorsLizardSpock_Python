# repo_RockPaperScissorsLS
My attempt at creating a basic python game that allows a user to go up against <br> 
a bot opponent at Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. <br>

This project helped me with finding out how inheritance worked within the Python <br>
atmosphere. I had a grasp at what the concept of inheritance was in Java, and I <br>
really liked the fact that Python handles inheritance with the use of parentheses <br>
in the class header, while also using the familiar terms like super() to bring in the <br> 
Parent class's methods. I found it strange that the Child classes did not have the <br>
@Override tag above the method description like how Java does it. With every project, <br>
I'm learning more and more that the differences in languages, although slight, can make <br>
things quite tedious!
